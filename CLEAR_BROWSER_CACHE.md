# üßπ Clear Browser Cache - Fix Stuck Loading

## The Issue
Even after creating `.env.local` and restarting the server, the app may still be stuck loading due to **cached authentication state** in the browser's local storage.

## Quick Fix

### Method 1: Clear Site Data (Recommended)
1. **Open the app** in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Open DevTools** - Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
3. **Go to Application tab** (or Storage in Firefox)
4. **Find "Local Storage"** in the left sidebar
5. **Click on** `http://localhost:3000`
6. **Right-click** and select **"Clear"**
7. **Also clear** "Session Storage" the same way
8. **Refresh the page** - Press `F5` or `Ctrl+R`

### Method 2: Hard Refresh
1. Open the app (http://localhost:3000)
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. This does a hard refresh and bypasses cache

### Method 3: Incognito/Private Window
1. Open a **new incognito/private window**
2. Go to http://localhost:3000
3. The app should work without cached data

### Method 4: Clear All Browser Data
1. Open browser settings
2. Search for "Clear browsing data"
3. Select:
   - ‚úÖ Cached images and files
   - ‚úÖ Cookies and other site data
4. Time range: "Last hour" or "All time"
5. Click "Clear data"
6. Refresh the app

## Why This Happens

When Supabase credentials were missing, the authentication context tried to load but failed, leaving corrupted data in the browser's local storage. This cached data persists even after fixing the `.env.local` file.

## What Gets Cleared

When you clear site data, you're removing:
- **Local Storage**: Cached user session, auth tokens
- **Session Storage**: Temporary app state
- **Cookies**: Authentication cookies
- **Cache**: Cached API responses

This forces the app to start fresh and properly initialize with your new Supabase credentials.

## After Clearing Cache

You should see:
1. ‚úÖ Landing page or Sign In screen (not loading screen)
2. ‚úÖ No errors in the browser console
3. ‚úÖ Ability to sign up or sign in
4. ‚úÖ Smooth authentication flow

## Still Not Working?

If clearing cache doesn't help, check:

1. **Server is running with new env vars**:
   ```bash
   # Stop all node processes
   Stop-Process -Name "node" -Force
   
   # Restart dev server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Environment variables are loaded**:
   - Open browser console
   - Check for "‚ùå Missing Supabase environment variables" errors
   - Should see Vite ready message without errors

3. **Supabase credentials are correct**:
   - Verify URL starts with `https://`
   - Verify anon key is a long JWT token
   - Check for typos in `.env.local`

4. **File is in correct location**:
   - `.env.local` should be in project root (same folder as `package.json`)
   - NOT in `src/` folder

**Quick Command to Verify**:
```bash
# Check if env file exists
Test-Path .env.local

# View env file content (PowerShell)
Get-Content .env.local
```
