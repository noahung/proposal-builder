# ProposalEditor - Final Critical Fixes

## Issues Fixed (October 6, 2025)

### 1. ‚úÖ Add Page Button Not Working

**Issue**: Clicking "Add Page" button didn't create a new page/section.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `createSection.mutateAsync()` wasn't returning the created section data
- No code to set the newly created section as the current active section

**Solution**:
```tsx
const handleAddSection = async () => {
  const nextOrderIndex = sections ? sections.length : 0;
  try {
    const result = await createSection.mutateAsync({
      proposal_id: proposalId,
      title: `Page ${nextOrderIndex + 1}`,  // Changed from "Section" to "Page"
      order_index: nextOrderIndex,
      elements: [],
    });
    
    // Set the newly created section as current
    if (result.data) {
      setCurrentSectionId(result.data.id);
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    alert(`Failed to create page: ${error.message}`);
  }
};
```

**Result**: 
- ‚úÖ Add Page button now creates a new page
- ‚úÖ Automatically switches to the newly created page
- ‚úÖ Page is titled "Page 1", "Page 2", etc.

### 2. ‚úÖ Page Rename Not Saving

**Issue**: Editing page name appeared to work but changes weren't persisting.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `onBlur` handler was calling `setEditingSectionId(null)` synchronously
- This closed the editing mode BEFORE the async `handleUpdateSectionTitle` completed
- The update was happening but the UI state was reset too early

**Solution**:
```tsx
// Made the event handlers async and await the update
onBlur={async () => {
  if (editingSectionTitle.trim() && editingSectionTitle !== section.title) {
    await handleUpdateSectionTitle(section.id, editingSectionTitle);
  } else {
    setEditingSectionId(null);
  }
}}

onKeyDown={async (e) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter') {
    if (editingSectionTitle.trim() && editingSectionTitle !== section.title) {
      await handleUpdateSectionTitle(section.id, editingSectionTitle);
    } else {
      setEditingSectionId(null);
    }
  } else if (e.key === 'Escape') {
    setEditingSectionId(null);
    setEditingSectionTitle(section.title);  // Reset to original
  }
}}
```

**Key Changes**:
- Made `onBlur` and `onKeyDown` handlers `async`
- Added `await` before `handleUpdateSectionTitle`
- Added check to only update if title actually changed
- Escape key now properly resets to original title
- Only closes editing mode after successful save

**Result**: 
- ‚úÖ Page rename now saves properly to database
- ‚úÖ Editing mode closes after successful save
- ‚úÖ Escape key cancels and restores original name
- ‚úÖ No unnecessary updates if name didn't change

### 3. ‚úÖ Delete Key Support for Elements

**Issue**: No way to delete selected elements using keyboard.

**Solution**: Added keyboard event listener for Delete and Backspace keys

```tsx
// Keyboard event handler for Delete key
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    // Delete or Backspace key to delete selected element
    if ((e.key === 'Delete' || e.key === 'Backspace') && selectedElement) {
      // Don't delete if user is typing in an input or textarea
      const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
      if (target.tagName === 'INPUT' || target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA') {
        return;
      }
      
      e.preventDefault();
      if (confirm('Delete this element?')) {
        setElements(elements.filter(el => el.id !== selectedElement));
        setSelectedElement(null);
      }
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
}, [selectedElement, elements]);
```

**Features**:
- Listens for Delete or Backspace key
- Only works when an element is selected
- Smart detection: doesn't delete if user is typing in input/textarea
- Shows confirmation dialog before deleting
- Properly cleans up event listener on unmount

**Result**: 
- ‚úÖ Delete key deletes selected element
- ‚úÖ Backspace key also works
- ‚úÖ Safe: won't interfere with typing in text fields
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Right-Click Context Menu for Elements

**Issue**: No right-click delete option for elements.

**Solution**: Added `onContextMenu` handler to element containers

```tsx
<div
  className={`w-full h-full p-2 rounded cursor-move ${
    isSelected ? 'bg-primary/5' : 'hover:bg-muted/20'
  } ${element.locked ? 'cursor-not-allowed' : ''}`}
  onClick={() => setSelectedElement(element.id)}
  onDoubleClick={() => setEditingElement(element.id)}
  onContextMenu={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setSelectedElement(element.id);
    
    // Show context menu options
    const shouldDelete = window.confirm('Delete this element?');
    if (shouldDelete) {
      setElements(elements.filter(el => el.id !== element.id));
      setSelectedElement(null);
    }
  }}
>
```

**Features**:
- Prevents default browser context menu
- Selects the element first
- Shows confirmation dialog
- Deletes element if confirmed

**Result**: 
- ‚úÖ Right-click on any element to delete
- ‚úÖ Automatically selects element before showing menu
- ‚úÖ Confirmation prevents accidental deletions

- Better async handling: UI waits for database saves to complete
- Smart keyboard detection: Won't delete when typing
- Confirmation dialogs: Prevents accidental data loss
- Escape key: Cancel rename and restore original name

### Code Quality
- Proper async/await patterns
