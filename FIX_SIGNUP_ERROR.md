# üîß FIX FOR "Database error saving new user"

## Root Cause Found! ‚úÖ

The error occurs because:
1. ‚úÖ RLS (Row Level Security) is **enabled** on `profiles` and `agencies` tables
2. ‚ùå There are **NO INSERT policies** for these tables
3. ‚ùå The signup trigger `handle_new_user()` tries to INSERT but RLS **blocks it**

## Solution: Add INSERT Policies

### Option 1: Quick Fix via Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste** this SQL:

```sql
-- Add INSERT policies for signup trigger
CREATE POLICY "Service role can insert agencies"
  ON agencies FOR INSERT
  TO service_role
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Service role can insert profiles"
  ON profiles FOR INSERT
  TO service_role
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
  ON profiles FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (id = auth.uid());
```

4. Click **Run**
5. Wait for "Success" message
6. **Try signing up again** - it should work now! üéâ

### Option 2: Run the Fix Script

I've created a file `supabase/add_insert_policies.sql` with the fix.

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. Copy contents of `supabase/add_insert_policies.sql`
3. Paste and **Run**
4. Try signup again

### Option 3: Reset and Re-run Migration

If you want a clean slate:

1. **Delete all data** from tables (if any test data exists):
```sql
DELETE FROM proposal_activities;
DELETE FROM attachments;
DELETE FROM proposal_sections;
DELETE FROM proposals;
DELETE FROM templates;
DELETE FROM clients;
DELETE FROM profiles;
DELETE FROM agencies;
```

2. **Drop and recreate policies**:
```sql
-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view profiles in their agency" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own agency" ON agencies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Agency owners/admins can update their agency" ON agencies;
```

3. **Run the updated migration** from `supabase/migrations/20251006000000_initial_schema.sql`
   - The file has been updated with the INSERT policies
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
   - Run the entire migration again

### Verify the Fix

After adding the policies, verify they exist:

```sql
SELECT 
  tablename,
  policyname,
  cmd,
  roles
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'agencies')
  AND cmd = 'INSERT'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
tablename | policyname                          | cmd    | roles
----------|-------------------------------------|--------|------------------
agencies  | Service role can insert agencies    | INSERT | {service_role}
profiles  | Service role can insert profiles    | INSERT | {service_role}
profiles  | Users can insert own profile        | INSERT | {authenticated}
```

## Test Signup Flow

After applying the fix:

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. **Refresh the page** (F5)
3. **Try signing up** with:
   - Name: Noah Aung
   - Company: Adverto Media Limited
   - Email: noah.aung@outlook.com
   - Password: (your password)

4. **Check browser console** - should see:
   ```
   Starting signup process...
   Signup successful: { user: {...}, session: {...} }
   ```

5. **Verify in Supabase**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     u.email,
     p.full_name,
     a.name as agency_name
   FROM auth.users u
   LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.id
   LEFT JOIN agencies a ON p.agency_id = a.id
   WHERE u.email = 'noah.aung@outlook.com';
   ```

## Why This Happened

The original migration file was missing INSERT policies because:
- We focused on SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE policies for agency isolation
- We assumed the trigger with `SECURITY DEFINER` would bypass RLS
- But Supabase requires explicit INSERT policies even for service operations

## Updated Files

‚úÖ `supabase/migrations/20251006000000_initial_schema.sql` - Now includes INSERT policies
‚úÖ `supabase/add_insert_policies.sql` - Quick fix SQL script
‚úÖ `supabase/fix_signup_trigger.sql` - Complete troubleshooting script
‚úÖ `supabase/fix_rls_for_signup.sql` - Alternative RLS fixes

## Next Steps After Fix

Once signup works:

1. ‚úÖ Test complete signup flow
2. ‚úÖ Test email confirmation (if enabled)
3. ‚úÖ Test signin with created account
4. ‚úÖ Verify agency and profile were created
5. ‚úÖ Move to Task 7: Connect UI to Backend
